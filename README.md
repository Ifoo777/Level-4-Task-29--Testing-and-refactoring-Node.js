# Level-4-Task-29--Testing-and-refactoring-Node.js

##Follow these steps:

● Create a Node.js app that includes a module that calculates the insurance
cost on a fleet of vehicles insured with pay-as-you-drive insurance. The app
should have an endpoint that takes as input the kilometers driven for each
vehicle. For each item, the app should calculate the insurance cost based on
the kilometers driven, before finally summing all the values and returning it
as the result.
Use the table below to calculate insurance costs.

● Do not duplicate algorithms in your tests. Pick a set of inputs, calculate the
correct answer by hand and check whether your module produces it. If you
do the calculations in your test code you’re not really testing anything - it
would be like checking that a calculator works using the same calculator.
● Refactor your previous task. Submit a report that includes:
○ A summary of how you had to change your code to conform to the
naming conventions specified in the Google Style guide found here.
○ Screenshots that show how you have changed your code to ensure
that you are now using Helmet to improve the security of your code.
○ A description of how you have changed your package.json file and
your config files to follow best practice guidelines. Also, include
screenshots of portions of your code that show the changes made to
your package.json and config files.
○ A description and screenshots of any other refactoring that you have
done. Which variables/functions/classes, etc have you renamed and
why? What code have you deleted and why? Which functions have
you changed and why?
